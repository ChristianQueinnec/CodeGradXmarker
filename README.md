# CodeGradXmarker

This is the CodeGradX marker and verbalizer library defined for a site
proposing Javascript exercises. It uses the `CodeGradXlib` module to
access the CodeGradX infrastructure and tries to display nicefully the
reports produced by CodeGradX. It also uses the `yasmini` module, a
reflective test framework reminiscent of Jasmine. Yasmini provides
'describe()' in the browser so students can work on Javascript
programs in the browser before submitting them towards CodeGradX.

## Details

The language (currently `fr` or `en` by default) may be set with
`yasmini.lang`.
